"""Time-based regression (TBR) for geo experiments, with A/A calibration.

TBR (Kerman, Wang & Vaver, 2017) fits treatment-group totals on control-group
totals in the pre-period, predicts what the treatment group would have done in
the test period, and reads the cumulative gap as the causal effect.

Two changes from the textbook fit, both found by A/A tests on PAWLY's history
(see docs/ai_workflow_log.md):
  * No intercept (proportional form). With an intercept, daily noise in the
    control total flattens the slope (regression dilution); whenever revenue
    grows between pre-period and test, the prediction lags and a fake positive
    effect appears (mean A/A z = +0.95).
  * The AR(1)-adjusted interval is still too narrow because group gaps drift
    slowly (ad-response and growth differences across regions). The standard
    error is multiplied by a factor learned from historical A/A tests of the
    same length, so that 95% of no-effect windows fall inside the interval.
